### Reflections and Comments

I'm pretty sure that I could use an array to make my code way more effecient.  I'll mess around with it tomorrow morning if I have time.

I also learned to be very careful about typing out the file path for using external docs.  I think I avoided the specific pitfall that Jacob and AJ mentioned, but I added an extra backslash at the front of the path, so github was trying to pull the file from a nonexistant path.  It took me a good 10 minutes and a lucky StackOverflow query to figure out why my Javascript wasn't working on the Github site.
