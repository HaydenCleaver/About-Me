## About Me



### Author: Hayden Cleaver
Website that gives a little background on myself and my work history/education. Includes a guessing game button that lets the user interact with the information provided.

**Lab03 Additions**: 

The education/experience sections have been reformatted into lists and a numbered 'top ten' list of hiking paths has been added.

The guessing game has also been expanded to include a random number guessing game as well as a final question that allows for multiple correct answers.

Additionally, there is now a counter that tracks how many correct answers you make during the game.

### Reflections and Comments

**Lab02:**

I'm pretty sure that I could use an array to make my code way more effecient.

I also learned to be very careful about typing out the file path for using external docs.  I think I avoided the specific pitfall that Jacob and AJ mentioned, but I added an extra backslash at the front of the path, so github was trying to pull the file from a nonexistant path.  It took me a good 10 minutes and a lucky StackOverflow query to figure out why my Javascript wasn't working on the Github site.

**Lab03 Comments:**

I struggled pretty hard with getting the logic for the 'for' loop down.  Specifically the flow of what it was controlling under it.

After I figured that out, it kind of clicked and got a lot easier.
