        <h4> Bio</h4>
        <p>
        My name is Hayden Cleaver.  I was born in Baltimore and have kind of lived all over the U.S.  But I'd say that 
        I'm mostly from the Midwest.  My favorite season is winter though fall is awesome too. I love rain, thunderstorms, 
        and snow. I wish I could just live in the middle of a constant blizzard.  I've always been a big reader, but I've 
        definitely expanded my nerdier interests over recent years.  My brothers even convinced me to give D&D a try a 
        couple of years back and that's been a fun reason to get together with them and our respective partners/families every 
        week or so &#40or play digitally&#41.  I also run quite a bit and finally got the green light to lift again after I injured 
        my arm a year and a half ago.  And I generally enjoy being outdoors, whether that means walking trails, kayaking/canoeing, 
        camping, or just traipsing through the woods.
        </p>

        <h4>Education and Experience</h4>
        <p>
        I worked for a couple of years in retail after graduating from high school, and then I joined the Air 
        Force as an Airborne Linguist for 6 years.  I went to DLI in Monterey, California for a couple of 
        years to learn Pashto before being stationed right outside of Omaha, Nebraska.  Since I got out of 
        the military I've been going to school part-time for a geology degree and working odd jobs.  I'm currently a 
        contract worker for a park that I live near, though my contract is paused while this class is going on.
        </p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
        The only concrete goal that I have for the time being is that I'd like to
        immigrate to Canada or Germany within the next few years.  I traveled outside of the U.S. a few times
        while I was in the Air Force, but I never got to really <i>live</i> anywhere else.
