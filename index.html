        <h4> Bio</h4>
        <p>
            My name is Hayden Cleaver. I was born in Baltimore and have kind of lived all over the U.S. But I'd say that
            I'm mostly from the Midwest. My favorite season is winter though fall is awesome too. I love rain,
            thunderstorms,
            and snow.<br><br>

            I've always been a big reader, but I've definitely expanded my nerdier interests over recent years
            to gaming and other stuff. I also run quite a bit and finally got the green light to lift again
            after I injured my arm a year and a half ago. And I generally enjoy being outdoors, whether that means
            walking mountain trails,
            canoeing/kayaking in lakes or off the coast, camping, or just traipsing through the woods.

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <p>
            The only concrete goal that I have for the time being is that I'd like to
            immigrate to Canada or Germany within the next few years. I traveled outside of the U.S. a few times
            while I was in the Air Force, but I never got to really <i>live</i> anywhere else.
