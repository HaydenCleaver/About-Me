        <h4> Bio</h4>
        <p>
        My name is Hayden Cleaver.  I'd say that I'm mostly from the Midwest, but I've
        kind of been all over the U.S. at one point or another.  I've always been big on reading
        but I've definitely increased the amount of hobby time I spend on gaming
        over the years.  My brothers even convinced me to give D&D a try a couple of years back 
        and that's been a fun reason to get together with them and our extended family members every week or so.  
        So at this point, I'd say that I've solidly crossed the line into being a nerd. <br>

        <h4>Education and Experience</h4>
        <p>
        I worked for a couple of years in retail after graduating from high school, and then I joined the Air 
        Force as an Airborne Linguist for 6 years.  I went to DLI in Monterey, California for a couple of 
        years to learn Pashto before being stationed right outside of Omaha, Nebraska.  Since I got out of 
        the military I've been going to school part-time for a geology degree and working odd jobs.  I'm currently a 
        contract worker for a park that I live near, though I'm obviously not really working while this class is going on.
